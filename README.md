# Object-Detection-by-using-YOLOv8-Model

Object Detection using YOLOv8

Description:
This project implements object detection using the YOLOv8 model, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm. The model is trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin cancer detection.

Features:

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv8
- Skin cancer detection using ISIC 2019 dataset
- High accuracy and precision in detecting skin cancer lesions
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean average precision (mAP)

I am looking to collaborate on:

- Improving model performance and accuracy
- Expanding the dataset to include more diverse skin cancer images
- Integrating the model into a web application or mobile app for real-world use
- Exploring transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained YOLOv8 models

Technologies Used:

- Python programming
- Jupyter Notebook
- YOLOv8 model
- ISIC 2019 dataset
- TensorFlow/Keras libraries

Getting Started:

- Clone the repository and install required libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the YOLOv8 model
- Explore the code and contribute your ideas!

Contributions:

- Bug fixes and code improvements
- New feature implementations (e.g., data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning)
- Documentation and README updates
